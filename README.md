I’ve been working on this **Weather & Sea Forecast Dashboard**, which is a clean, visual way to check both land and marine conditions at a glance. I wanted to build something that felt organized and professional, so I used a grid-based layout to separate the different types of data.

### **What’s inside the project:**

* **Current Local Weather:** The main focus is a primary weather card that shows the current day (Sunday), the condition (Sunny), and the temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit. I also included a wind speed indicator to give a fuller picture of the current environment.
* **Marine Forecast Section:** Since standard weather apps often ignore the ocean, I added a specialized "Sea Forecast Report." This section tracks specific data points like wave height, wave period, and wind gusts in knots—essential info for anyone heading out on the water.
* **7-Day Outlook:** Below the main reports, I built a row of mini-cards that give a quick preview of the rest of the week, from Monday through Saturday. Each day has its own unique weather icon to make it easy to scan quickly.

### **How I built it:**

I used **Bootstrap 5** to make sure the layout stayed aligned and looked good on different screen sizes. For the visuals, I integrated **Font Awesome** icons and custom weather images to give it a more modern, "app-like" feel. The whole project is wrapped in a centered container so it feels balanced right in the middle of the screen.
